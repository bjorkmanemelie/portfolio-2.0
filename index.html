                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <div class="about-me">
                        <p>Hi there - I'm Emelie Björkman, a passionate fullstack developer with a knack for creating
                            engaging
                            and user-friendly web experiences.
                            With my passion for coding and design, I bring a unique perspective to every project I
                            undertake.
                            My journey into web development began with a fascination for how websites are built and has
                            since evolved into a full-fledged career.
                            I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to
                            enhance my skills. When I'm not coding,
                            you probably find me watching football or out in the woods with my family.</p>
